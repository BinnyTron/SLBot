# SLBot
 SecondLife Bot 
 
# What is this and what do I need to know about it?
 This is a basic set of python scripts that will log an avatar into secondlife. 
 Use an existing SL account and edit the username and password sections of the main code 
 with your own user name and password and run the scripts. Be sure to log in first, go 
 to an area in SL where your main account will be, then logout (then run the script.) 
 If you don't do this, there is currenly no way to tell where your bot will have
 logged in to.

# How do I run this?
 Copy the folder to your local machine. 
 Change directory to the code directory 
 Enter the command on the command line: 
 python main.py 
 You will need Python 3 installed on your computer.
 
# What is the purpose of this project? what is the scope? 
 The main idea is to provide a simple and clean interface that 
 can be extended. This will not integrate LLM or provide enhanced features
 but instead function as a dependable module that is easy to use and understand.

# Latest updates 
 The initial commit is simply a rough code dump.
 The code is not clean and lacks unit tests.
